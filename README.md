# Pixelflut 

A repository of my Pixelflut code from MCH 2022 Field Weekend. 

## python_scripts

Just one. Generates a set of rainbow commands. 

## shell_scripts

The bits that do the actual flooding. Check the readme. 

## outputs

Where the command files generated by scripts go. Examples included. 

## The future... 

I may tidy it up, deduplicate and/or write some nicer interfaces. 

It's published as a useful tool or reference for others who need to get started quickly.
