# shell_scripts

- `countdown.sh`: turns the tower red, decreases the red on a 4 minute countdown 
- `rainbow_write.sh`: writes the output of the rainbow Python script (or shuffled version) to the tower
- `random_colours_single.sh`: single TCP packet with contents of `image.pf` 
- `random_colours.sh`: TCP and UDP random colours 

Note:
- These are not designed to be engaging outputs on their own - Pixelflut is a 'competitive sport' and so the best displays are the result of the network onslaught 
- TCP/UDP can be used fairly interchangeably in all of these scripts depending on the limitations of what you're flooding 
- Some bits are commented out - you can swap them in and out to get different effects
